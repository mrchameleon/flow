Misc Notes of My Own, Less stolen from Gene Kim and more random on the topic of 'process' in engineering


*1:  (Clickup, Trello, JIRA boards)


*2: RE: process... it might be good for us to have a flow like dev->qa->staging->production (less stable to more stable)


and do testing automated and manual, get different humans to test software


put developers in contact directly with stakeholders who will use the product - or a good proxy for those users


customer advisory board
